How does the internet work?
    The internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.
    Each computer on a network is connected to a router.
    router makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer.
    To connect our network to the telephone infrastucture, we need a modem.
    the modem turns the info from our network into info manageable by the telephone infrastucture and vice versa.
    Next step to connect the network to an ISP to access other ISPs' routers.
    


    What happens when you click on a link? 
    I want to browse a website, so I ask the DNS server for the IP address
    The DNS server gives me the website's IP address
    now that I know the IP address, I can communicate with the host server and browse the website.
